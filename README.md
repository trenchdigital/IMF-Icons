# IMF Icon set

![Repo Header Image](header.jpg)

A collection of graphical Icons used to denote the internal framework of the Interoperable Master Format, as used in the Essential Training - IMF course.

Each filetype icon is available in four file formats:
 * original PNG format by @trenchdigital: 512×512 pixels, RGBA (32 bits/pixel)
 * Windows icon file format (`.ico` extension): 512×512 down to 16×16 pixels, RGBA (32bpp), 256-color and 16-color
 * macOS icon file format (`.icns` extension):  512×512 down to 16×16 pixels, RGBA (32bpp), 256-color and 16-color
 * One unique icon library (`.icl` extension) collecting all of the filetype icons (in all of their variants) in one file, usable by any OSs; this latter file is Gzipped to reduce storage footprint

Icons originally designed by [Jack Watts](https://github.com/jack-watts).
Conversions into OS icons by [Walter Arrighetti](http://github.com/walter-arrighetti).

Sizes 512×512 down to 16×16 pixels, at 32bits/pixel, 256-colors and 16-colors (EGA palette), with nonlinear scaling of graphic details (“opticals”).
